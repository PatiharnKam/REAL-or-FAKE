# RE-AL or FA-KE
## Project Overview
The **RE-AL or FA-KE** is an image processing project that uses a deep learning model to predict whether an image is a drawing generated by AI or a drawing created by a human artist. The model classifies images into two categories: AI-generated or human-made artwork.

This project integrates the model with a web application developed using Streamlit, enabling users to interact with the model and predict the origin of the image through an easy-to-use interface.
